# Open-CV-projects-collections
This repository contains a collection of small projects built using OpenCV in Python. Each project demonstrates a different computer vision technique, from basic image processing to real-world applications like object tracking and AR effects.
üìÇ Projects
1. Bucket Check
Detects the level of fullness in a bucket using contour and edge detection.
Can be used in automation tasks to monitor liquid or object levels.
2. Color Detection
Identifies and highlights a specific color in a live video feed or image.
Useful for object sorting, filtering, and basic vision-based robotics.
3. Face and Eye Detection
Uses Haar cascades to detect faces and eyes in real time.
Highlights the detected regions with bounding boxes.
4. Image Filters
Applies different blur filters such as Gaussian Blur, Median Blur, and Bilateral Filter.
Demonstrates the effects of each filter on images.
5. Image Stitching
Stitches together cracked or split images to form a single output.
Uses feature detection and homography.
6. Object Tracking
Tracks a selected object in video using tracking algorithms (e.g., KCF, CSRT).
Useful for surveillance and motion analysis.
7. Scanner (Image Transformation)
Transforms a photographed document into a top-down scanned version.
Includes perspective transformation and thresholding.
8. Shape Detection
Detects basic geometric shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle, etc.) in images.
Uses contour approximation and edge detection.
9. AR Poster
Augments a poster or image with a video overlay.
A basic Augmented Reality project built with OpenCV.
